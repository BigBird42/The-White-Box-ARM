LCD display
-----------
The display's UI has multiple menu's which can be seen below. The character range is listed on page 9 of the LCD datasheet 
(http://www.newhavendisplay.com/specs/NHD-0420H1Z-FL-GBW-33V3.pdf).


Effect Select Menu
------------------
The effect select menu is the default menu loaded upon starting. ENC_1 or SW_left and SW_right move through the presets. 
SW_select enables a new effect preset(Pre 2 in the case) and disables the previous one. The settings button moves to the 
settings menu. ENC4_SW enters the effect edit menu for the effect in the middle preset(Pre 2 in the case) and enables it.
========================
|| Effect Select Menu ||  Name of menu
||       Sch 1        ||  Current enabled effect preset
||Pre 1| Pre 2  |Pre 3||  Preset number
||Sch 1|Schism 2|46&2 ||  Preset nickname
========================


Settings Menu
-------------
The settings menu allows the user to change settings such as the brightness of the LED's. A flashing < on the right side of 
the screen denotes the setting currently being changed. ENC1 moves up/down through the current setting being edited when 
rotated clockwise/counter-clockwise(CW/CCW). SW_LEFT and SW_RIGHT move up/down through the current setting being edited. 
ENC2 increments/decrements the current setting when rotated CW/CCW, does nothing to boolean settings. SW_select toggles 
the boolean setting being edited. SW_settings returns to the Effect Select Menu.
========================
||   Settings Menu    ||  Name of menu
||setting 1         1 ||  Setting
||LED brightness   10<||  Setting
||LCD brightness  100 ||  Setting
========================


Effect Edit Menu
----------------
The effect edit menu allows the user to change effect parameters for a preset. Each encoder ENCx increments/decrements 
the corresponding effect parameter Px when rotated CW/CCW. SW_left and SW_right or ENC1_SW and ENC2_SW  move to the next 
effect type. The settings button opens the effect name edit menu. The effect select button returns back to the effect select menu.
========================
||      Schism  1     ||  Name of effect preset
||        Wah         ||  Name of effect being edited

||    7|   4|   0|   0||  Effect values usually on range 0-100
========================


Effect name edit menu
---------------------
The effect name edit menu allows the user to change the name and nickname for a preset. A flashing cursor denotes the 
character currently being changed, the flashing character is ascii 255 on page 9 of the datasheet linked above. ENC1 moves 
the cursor left/right when turned CW/CCW. ENC2 moves up/down through ascii characters when turned CW/CCW, the range is from 
ascii 32-127 see page 9 of the datasheet linked above. The SW_select button saves the preset name and returns to the effect 
edit menu, the settings button returns but without saving. The Effect Nickname is only used in the effect select menu, 
it's 8 characters long when it's in the middle section of the menu but the 2 rightmost characters are removed when it's on 
either the left or right side.

||      Schism  1     ||  Name of effect preset
||Effect Nickname:    ||  
||Sch 1   |           ||  Shortened name for the preset
